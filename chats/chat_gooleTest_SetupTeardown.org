*** Using gtest, I need to test the function =void ft_lstadd_front(t_list **lst, t_list *new);=. I would like it to be a parametrized test, how could i achieve that?


To create a parameterized test using Google Test for the function =void ft_lstadd_front(t_list **lst, t_list *new)= you can use the =INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P= macro. This macro allows you to define a parameterized test suite and then instantiate it with different sets of parameters.

Here's an example of how you can set up a parameterized test for the =ft_lstadd_front= function using Google Test:

#+begin_src cpp
#include "your_header_containing_ft_lstadd_front.h"
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class LstAddFrontTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::tuple<t_list*, t_list*>> {};

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(InstantiationName, LstAddFrontTest,
    testing::Values(
        std::make_tuple(new t_list(), new t_list()),  // Replace with actual test data
        std::make_tuple(nullptr, new t_list()),  // Another set of parameters
        // Add more sets of parameters as needed
    ));

TEST_P(LstAddFrontTest, TestLstAddFront) {
    t_list* lst = std::get<0>(GetParam());
    t_list* newElem = std::get<1>(GetParam());

    // Call your function here
    ft_lstadd_front(&lst, newElem);

    // Add your assertions here
    // For example:
    ASSERT_EQ(lst->next, newElem);
    ASSERT_EQ(newElem->next, nullptr);
}
#+end_src

In this test setup:
1. =LstAddFrontTest= is a fixture class derived from =testing::TestWithParam<std::tuple<t_list*, t_list*>>=, which means it is a parameterized test fixture that takes a tuple of two =t_list*= parameters.
2. The =INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P= macro is used to define the parameterized test suite. You can provide different sets of parameters to test various scenarios.
3. =TEST_P= defines the test pattern, allowing you to write tests that will be run with each set of parameters defined in the instantiation.
4. Inside the test body, you can access the parameters using =GetParam()=. In this example, =lst= and =newElem= are extracted from the tuple and passed to the =ft_lstadd_front= function for testing.
5. Assertions can be used to verify the behavior of the function based on the given parameters.

Remember to replace the =testing::Values= with actual test data that covers the scenarios you want to test.

*** Please explain the the lines in INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P in greater detail. How could i add actual test data? The struct for my t_list is as follows
#+begin_src c
typedef struct s_list
{
	void			*content;
	struct s_list	*next;
}					t_list;
#+end_src


The =INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P= macro in Google Test is used to define a parameterized test suite. Let's break down how to use it in more detail:

1. *Syntax*:
#+begin_src cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(InstantiationName, TestSuiteName, ParameterValues);
#+end_src
- =InstantiationName=: A descriptive name for the instantiation of the parameterized test suite.
- =TestSuiteName=: The name of the test suite or fixture class that the test will be applied to.
- =ParameterValues=: A way to provide sets of parameters for the test. In this case, =testing::Values= is used to specify multiple sets of parameters.

2. *Adding Test Data*:
Given your =t_list= structure:
#+begin_src c
typedef struct s_list
{
    void *content;
    struct s_list *next;
} t_list;
#+end_src

To add actual test data for this structure in the =INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P= macro, you can define instances of =t_list= with varying data to cover different cases. For example:
#+begin_src cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(AddFrontTestSet, LstAddFrontTest,
    testing::Values(
        std::make_tuple(
            new t_list{.content = (void*)1, .next = nullptr},  // Example data for lst
            new t_list{.content = (void*)2, .next = nullptr}   // Example data for new
        ),
        std::make_tuple(
            new t_list{.content = (void*)5, .next = nullptr},  // Another set of data for lst
            new t_list{.content = (void*)10, .next = nullptr}  // Another set of data for new
        ),
        // Add more tuples with different test data as needed
    )
);
#+end_src

In this example:
- We use =std::make_tuple= to create sets of parameters, where each tuple contains instances of =t_list= structs with different content and next values.
- You can create multiple tuples with different data combinations to cover various scenarios that you want to test in your =ft_lstadd_front= function.
- Make sure to handle memory management properly, especially for dynamic memory allocations like in the case of creating new =t_list= instances.

By providing different sets of test data in the =testing::Values= part of =INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P=, you can execute the parameterized tests with these specific parameters, allowing you to test various cases and ensure the correctness of your =ft_lstadd_front= function for different inputs.

*** why do you use ASSERT instead of EQUAL?

In Google Test, both =ASSERT= and =EXPECT= macros are used for making assertions in test cases. The difference between them lies in how they handle assertion failures:

1. /ASSERT/:
   - If an =ASSERT= statement fails, it indicates a fatal failure, causing the test to stop executing at that point. Subsequent assertions in the same test may not be checked.
   - Any failure in an =ASSERT= statement will cause the overall test to be marked as a failure.
   - Use =ASSERT= when the failure of that particular assertion means the test cannot continue sensibly or the subsequent assertions wouldn't make sense to check.

2. /EXPECT/:
   - If an =EXPECT= statement fails, it indicates a non-fatal failure, allowing the test to continue executing even if the assertion fails.
   - Subsequent assertions in the same test will still be checked even if an =EXPECT= statement fails.
   - Use =EXPECT= when the failure of that particular assertion should be recorded, but the test can still proceed and check other conditions.

In the context of unit tests, it's generally recommended to use =EXPECT= over =ASSERT= unless you have a specific reason to stop the test immediately upon failure. This allows you to capture more information about the state of the system under test and potentially find multiple issues in a single test case run.

In the example I provided earlier:
- =ASSERT_EQ= is used to check if two values are equal. If the values are not equal, the test will fail immediately, and no further assertions in the same test are checked.
- =ASSERT_EQ(lst->next, newElem)= verifies that the =next= pointer of =lst= points to =newElem=, ensuring that the =ft_lstadd_front= function properly inserts the new element at the front of the list.

If you prefer a more lenient approach and want to continue with the remaining checks even if a comparison fails, you can consider using =EXPECT_EQ= instead of =ASSERT_EQ=. Just remember that the choice between =ASSERT= and =EXPECT= depends on your specific testing requirements and the behavior you want for your tests.

*** I would need to deallocate the elements of the tuple. How could i do that?

To deallocate the elements of the tuple containing instances of =t_list= in your Google Test parameterized test, you can ensure proper memory cleanup by adding code to delete the allocated =t_list= instances after the test has been run. Here's how you can modify your parameterized test to handle deallocation:

#+begin_src cpp
// Definition of the fixture class
class LstAddFrontTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::tuple<t_list*, t_list*>> {
public:
    ~LstAddFrontTest() {
        // Deallocate the t_list instances after the test
        delete std::get<0>(GetParam());
        delete std::get<1>(GetParam());
    }
};

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(AddFrontTestSet, LstAddFrontTest,
    testing::Values(
        std::make_tuple(
            new t_list{.content = (void*)1, .next = nullptr},
            new t_list{.content = (void*)2, .next = nullptr}
        ),
        // Add more tuples with different test data
    )
);

TEST_P(LstAddFrontTest, TestLstAddFront) {
    t_list* lst = std::get<0>(GetParam());
    t_list* newElem = std::get<1>(GetParam());

    ft_lstadd_front(&lst, newElem);

    // Add your assertions here

    // No need to explicitly deallocate here as it will be handled by the fixture destructor
}
#+end_src

In this updated code snippet:
- The destructor of the =LstAddFrontTest= fixture class is defined to handle the deallocation of the =t_list= instances. It deletes the instances stored in the tuple =GetParam()= after the test has finished executing.
- By deleting the allocated memory in the destructor, you ensure that memory is properly cleaned up after each test case is run, regardless of whether the test passes or fails.

With this modification, you can safely deallocate memory for the =t_list= instances used in your parameterized tests, preventing memory leaks and ensuring proper memory management throughout the test execution.

*** how I can I tell what is done before and what after each test is ran?

In Google Test, you can use test fixtures to define setup and teardown routines that run before and after each test case is executed. These setup and teardown functions allow you to perform actions such as initializing resources before a test and cleaning up after the test has completed. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. /Define a Test Fixture/:
   - Create a class that inherits from =testing::Test=. This class will act as your test fixture.
   - Implement the virtual methods =SetUp()= and =TearDown()= to define the setup and teardown actions.

Example:
#+begin_src cpp
class MyTestFixture : public testing::Test {
protected:
    void SetUp() override {
        // Setup actions before each test case
        // For example, initialize resources
    }

    void TearDown() override {
        // Teardown actions after each test case
        // For example, clean up resources
    }
};
#+end_src

2. /Use the Test Fixture in Tests/:
   - Use your custom test fixture class as the base class for the test cases that require setup and teardown routines.

Example:
#+begin_src cpp
TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestName) {
    // Test code goes here
}
#+end_src

3. /Setup and Teardown for Parameterized Tests/:
   - If you are using parameterized tests, you can still use test fixtures by defining separate setup and teardown routines for them.

Example:
#+begin_src cpp
class MyParametrizedFixture : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {
protected:
    void SetUp() override {
        // Setup actions before each test case
    }

    void TearDown() override {
        // Teardown actions after each test case
    }
};

TEST_P(MyParametrizedFixture, TestName) {
    int param = GetParam();
    // Test code using the parameter
}
#+end_src

With this approach, the =SetUp()= method is called before each test case, and the =TearDown()= method is called after each test case in your fixture class. This allows you to set up any necessary state before running the test and clean up afterward, ensuring that each test case starts in a known state and leaves the environment in a consistent state when it finishes.

By using test fixtures and the setup/teardown methods provided by Google Test, you can easily control the setup and cleanup actions that occur before and after each test case, improving the maintainability and reliability of your test suite.
