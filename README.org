* What is libft
=Libft= is the continuiation of what students learned in their [[https://github.com/Keisn1/C-piscine-42][42piscine]], the initial qualification phase for the school.

=Libft= is a project where students build their very first C library. The students learn more about the infrastructure and organization of C. They learn about *static libraries*, what they are, how they are compiled, and how others can use them. Furthermore, the students gain hands-on experience with Makefiles in order to build their library.

The library itself is a collection of functionality mostly focused on input/output operations, but it also includes memory manipulation and an implementation of a =linked list=. Throughout the course, it will serve as a replacement for =stdio=, and the students are required to use it and expand it for further use ([[https://github.com/Keisn1/ft_printf][ft_printf]], [[https://github.com/Keisn1/get-next-line][get-next-line]]).

Moreover, the students are exposed to extensive testing and are required to test their code at a very early stage. In that sense, it is just a continuation of what they were already exposed to during the piscine. The moulinette is a very meticulous program that every student needs to submit their code to. This teaches the students to be extremely rigorous and attentive to detail at a very early stage.

The most important aspect of =libft= is that it is the first project at the school. Students get to know their peers and will perform peer evaluations from day one. This exposure to other people's code and discussions about code and ideas is what makes the school special. They learn to discuss their code so that others can understand them, forcing them to think about the other' perpective. They learn to formulate their ideas concisely and comprehensibly from the first day. Moreover, they develop the habit to ask their peers for help if they are not able to advance by themselves, which in turn teaches everybody to teach code and make it understandable.
